Disposal Date Calculator for Radioactive Material

Dear colleagues,

I developed a program in PHP version: 7.3.12 to calculate the date for low and medium activity level material disposal. It was based in a publication from our national commission (Brazil) but as it was based in publications of IAEA, probably several countries adopted the same disposal levels otherwise there is an option to set parameters by yourselves.

It is hosted in: https://calcradio.000webhostapp.com 

If somebody wants to download the program to improve or modify or host it in your website, its code and DB is available here:

I only ask to maintain the sentence: Originally developed by: Ary de Araujo Rodrigues Junior.

Note1: Its is better visualized utilizing the Google Chrome navigator.

Note2: Its data base contains 767 radionuclides whose half-lifes were got from a IAEA site (https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VchartHTML.html), that were transformed in decays per day one by one. Therefore could be some mistakes.

Thank you and enjoy yourselves
